  <div class="card">
  <h2> Why we use Renewable Energy Sources</h2>
  <img src="core/css/img/ICT PICTURES/Energy sources vector illustration collection – VectorMine.jpg" style="float:left; margin-left:15px; width:350px">
 <p><br><br>
  Renewable energy sources are a replacement for Fossil fuels. We've been using Fossile fuels since the start of the Industrial Era. Fossil fuels take millions of years to from. As the years pass, fossil fuels have been running out due to the overuse of Industrials. This is where Renewable Energy sources becomes valuable as they can be used up as many times as they like.
  There are many types of renewable energy sources, being, Hyro Energy, Solar Energy, Wind Energy, Geothermal Energy and Biomass Energy, etc.
  <br><br>The reason why we use Renewable energy includes: Preventing global warming, preventing unusual weather, keeping the atmosphere etc.
  Renewable energy sources are much better than fossile fuels as they can be used infinitely and are not harmful to the atmosphere.
  <br><br> Lets look at the facts for each energy type!

 <h2 style="text-align:center">Hydro Energy</h2>

  <p>
    Hydropower is a clean, renewable, and highly efficient energy source that generates electricity from the power of moving or falling water. It is the single largest renewable energy source globally, accounting for about 15% of total electricity production from all sources in 2022.
    <br><br> <b>How it Works:</b> Water flows through an intake and spins a turbine, which is connected to a generator. The generator then converts this rotational (mechanical) energy into electrical energy, which is sent through power lines to homes and businesses.
    <br><br> It is highly efficient, converting over 90% of available energy into electricity, a much higher rate than even the best fossil fuel plants. It can provide stable and dispatchable power, meaning it can respond very quickly to changes in electricity demand or provide backup power during grid blackouts.

  <h2> Solar Energy </h2>

 <p>
<br>Solar energy is an abundant, clean, and increasingly affordable renewable energy source that works by converting sunlight into electricity using photovoltaic panels. It is the most abundant energy resource on Earth, has minimal environmental impact during operation, and can help lower electricity bills. Key aspects include its long panel lifespan, low maintenance needs, and ability to produce power even on cloudy days.
<br><br>The sun provides more energy in one hour than the world uses in a year, and it is a sustainable, renewable resource. Solar power generation produces no air pollution or greenhouse gas emissions during operation, making it a clean alternative to fossil fuels. Solar is now considered one of the cheapest sources for new electricity generation, and the cost of panels has decreased significantly over time.

<div class="card">
 <h2 style="text-align:center;">Wind Energy</h2>
 <img src="core/css/img/ICT PICTURES/Best Wind Energy Stocks for 2025 _ The Motley Fool.jpg" style="float:right; width:400px;">
  <p>
         Wind energy is a major, fast-growing renewable and clean energy source that uses wind turbines to convert the wind's kinetic energy into electricity. It produces no greenhouse gases during operation and has low operating costs once installed. 
         Wind blows the blades of a turbine, which spins a rotor connected to a drive shaft. This shaft turns a generator, which produces electricity that is then sent to the power grid.
         <br><br>Wind power has been harnessed for thousands of years, with ancient civilizations using windmills to pump water and grind grain, and mariners using wind to sail. 
         <br><br> Despite its benefits, the industry faces challenges, including high initial capital investment, issues with energy transmission from remote wind farms to cities, visual impact on landscapes, and noise concerns. Careful planning and research are ongoing to mitigate these impacts on local ecosystems and communities.

  <h2> Geothermal Energy </h2>
  <img src="core/css/img/ICT PICTURES/Geothermal Energy vs_ Solar Power_ A Comprehensive Comparison.jpg" style="float:left; margin-left:15px; width:450px">
 <p>
Geothermal energy is a renewable energy source derived from the Earth's natural internal heat. It provides a constant, reliable (baseload) supply of heat and electricity, independent of weather or time of day, and offers lower operational costs compared to many other sources, despite high initial investment costs. 
<br><br>Traditional geothermal resources are most accessible in areas with volcanic activity or thin earth's crust, often near tectonic plate boundaries. New technologies like Enhanced Geothermal Systems (EGS) are expanding where it can be used by artificially creating permeability in hot dry rock.
<br><br>It is a renewable resource that operates 24/7, providing a constant baseload power supply, unlike intermittent solar and wind energy.

<div class="card">
 <h2 style="text-align:center;"> Biomass Energy </h2>
 <img src="core/css/img/ICT PICTURES/Biogas diagram stock vector_ Illustration of waste, infographic - 36146824.jpg" style="float:right; margin-bottom:50px; width:300px">
 <p>
<br>Biomass energy comes from organic matter like plants and animals and is a renewable energy source that can be converted into heat, electricity, or biofuels. It is versatile and can use waste products from agriculture, forestry, and urban areas, and is considered potentially carbon-neutral because the carbon released is recaptured by new plants through photosynthesis. 
<br><br>Biomass contains stored chemical energy from the sun. Plants produce biomass through photosynthesis. Biomass can be burned directly for heat or converted to renewable liquid and gaseous fuels through various processes. Examples include firewood, crop residues, animal manure, municipal solid waste, and biodiesel from vegetable oils.
<br><br>Biomass energy production has higher adverse environmental impact than its consumption. Positive changes in biomass energy largely worsen the environment more than its negative changes.
